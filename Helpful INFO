Many elements need div containers for positioning

/* This is a css comment */
<!-- This is an html comment -->

Sometimes it's better to just make a 
background image inside of a div
instead of an img element.

Adding borders just for spacing helps,
remove when done.

px is actually underratted. vw messes shite up

Using block containers inside of flex for positioning helps.
